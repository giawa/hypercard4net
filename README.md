# HyperCard For .NET
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/giawa/hypercard4net.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/giawa/hypercard4net)

Bits and pieces of a HyperCard parser/player in C#

## Features
* Stack, master reference, list, page, card, background, bitmap, button and field chunk processing
* WOBA processing and export to .PNG (and any other .NET supported Bitmap file format)
* Macintosh ICON processing and conversion to .PNG (and any other .NET supported Bitmap file format) with a color key for transparency
* Basic card rendering, including bitmaps, some icons, button and field support
* Navigation via next card/previous card (using left and right arrow keys)

## Example Stacks
This git project includes a few example stacks (in the Examples directory).  These stacks were taken from a HyperCard 2.4 release.  I am not the copyright holder of the example stacks, and they are provided for reference and test purposes only.  Since I am not bundling a version of HyperCard itself with these stacks I believe that I am distributing the stacks under fair use.
